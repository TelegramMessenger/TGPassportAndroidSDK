## Installing
#### Install from Maven

Telegram Passport SDK is available from the Maven repository.
Add this line to the dependencies section in your build.gradle:

    compile 'org.telegram:passport:1.1'
and sync your project.
#### Add as a module
Download the library, unzip it and copy the library project to the root of your project directory (the one with settings.gradle and gradle.properties). Then, make the following changes to your Gradle scripts.

In settings.gradle, add `':telegrampassport'` to includes:

    include ':app', ':telegrampassport'
In the build.gradle file for your app, add this line to the dependencies section:

    compile ':telegrampassport'
and sync your project.
## Using
#### Add a button
The SDK provides the "Log in with Telegram" button we recommend using for a consistent user experience across different apps. You can either add it from your Java code:

```java
TelegramLoginButton telegramButton;
// ...
telegramButton=new TelegramLoginButton(this);
// Optionally you can change the roundness of the button corners
// to better fit your design.
telegramButton.setCornerRoundness(1f);
viewGroupOfSomeSort.addView(telegramButton, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
```
 Or from XML:

```xml
<org.telegram.passport.TelegramLoginButton
			     android:layout_width="wrap_content"
			     android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			     app:cornerRoundness="0.5"/>
```

#### Request authorization

The button doesn't do anything by itself; you need to set an OnClickListener on it to start the authorization flow (replace the comments with the actual parameters):

```java
private static final int TG_PASSPORT_RESULT=352; // this can be any integer less than 0xFFFF
// ...
telegramButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
@Override
public void onClick(View view){
    TelegramPassport.AuthRequest req=new TelegramPassport.AuthRequest();
    req.botID=/* your bot ID here */;
    req.publicKey=/* your bot public key here */;
    req.nonce=/* a unique payload to pass to the bot server */;
    // Request either a passport or an ID card with selfie, a driver license, personal details with
    // name as it appears in the documents, address with any address document, and a phone number.
    // You could also pass a raw JSON object here if that's what works better for you
    // (for example, if you already get it from your server in the correct format).
    req.scope=new PassportScope(
        new PassportScopeElementOneOfSeveral(PassportScope.PASSPORT, PassportScope.IDENTITY_CARD).withSelfie(),
        new PassportScopeElementOne(PassportScope.PERSONAL_DETAILS).withNativeNames(),
        PassportScope.DRIVER_LICENSE,
        PassportScope.ADDRESS,
        PassportScope.ADDRESS_DOCUMENT,
        PassportScope.PHONE_NUMBER
    );
    TelegramPassport.request(MyActivity.this, req, TG_PASSPORT_RESULT);
}});
```
If you need finer-grained control over the process, `TelegramPassport` class contains a couple more methods:

 - `getAuthIntent(AuthParams)` returns an `Intent` for you to use in `startActivityForResult` if you need to do that in some special way. Be sure to check that there's actually an app to handle this intent before starting it by using `PackageManager` or `intent.resolveActivity`.
 - `showAppInstallAlert(Activity)` shows an alert that the user needs to install Telegram in order to continue. This is intended to be used together with the previous method in case when the app isn't installed.

#### Handle the result
The result is delivered via the `onActivityResult` method in your activity with the request code you passed to `TelegramPassport.request`. Currently, the only meaningful parameter is `resultCode`, which is `RESULT_OK` if the authorization was successful and `RESULT_CANCELED` otherwise.
